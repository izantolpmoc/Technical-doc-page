            TOKYO —When Izumi finally tired of her husband's affairs, she decided it was time to separate and made plans to take their three young children with her.

But her husband was one step ahead. He prevented her from taking the children and soon denied her the right to even see them after the divorce.

That was three years ago. Izumi, who asked that her family name be withheld to protect her children’s identities, hasn’t met them since.

Within a month, Izumi said, her children had been taught to say: <code>“I hate my mom.”</code> </p>


<p>But when she took her case to court, she received a reply that is all too familiar to thousands of Japanese parents. The children were now settled with a former spouse, and visits would only disturb them and their new household, a judge said before giving sole custody to the father. Izumi would have to make do with being sent photographs once a month.

Japan is unusual among developed nations in not recognizing the concept of joint custody. Its custom of granting sole custody to one parent means that hundreds of thousands of mothers and fathers face potential barriers to seeing their children, and that children are being denied the right to see both of their parents as they grow up, lawyers say.

        <header>Rights for children</header>

        <p>But now, a combination of international pressure and a legal effort in Japan could bring a reexamination of the country’s custody laws.

            Tomoshi Sakka, a lawyer who has handled rights cases, said there is growing public awareness that children have fundamental rights of their own to see both parents.
            
            <code>“The law tends to see the issues in terms of parents but not of children’s fundamental rights,” </code> he said.</p>

        <p>
            Sakka has filed three <code>“intertwined” </code> court cases, arguing that parents have a fundamental human right under Japan’s constitution to see their children, that the lack of a law preventing parents from leaving with their children is an unconstitutional violation of children’s rights, and that courts should enforce parental visitation rights.

All of the cases are at different stages, but a verdict in the first is expected in November.

Japanese courts operate on what’s known as the <code>“continuity principle,”</code> almost always granting sole custody to whoever has physical control of the children when a case comes before them.

That reflects Japan’s now-abolished family system that saw children as <code>“possessions”</code> of households and the prevailing idea that courts shouldn’t disturb those households. It is also an idea Japan’s conservative establishment clings to.

What that means in practice is that parents seeking custody of their children need only to abscond with them to a new location and deny the other parent access. Courts almost always reward the “kidnapper” by granting sole custody.

Courts in Japan lack the specific legal right to enforce visitation rights, meaning it is effectively up to the custodial parent’s discretion whether the other parent gets even occasional access or news.

        <p>The issue has long been associated in the media and the public mind with foreign fathers, who have protested for years after their Japanese wives absconded with their children and then refused to let them see them.</p>
        <p>Some Japanese men are now coming forward and pushing for the right to see their children. So are Japanese women such as Izumi.

            Japan’s Justice Ministry has argued that the current custody rules are designed in the best interests of children. When marriages end badly, it is less unsettling for children to be raised by a single parent, officials contend.</p>
        <p>Challenges also are brewing outside Japan. A campaign by a French father and an Italian father have also brought significant pressure on Japan to review its laws.

            Vincent Fichot and Tommaso Perina’s lobbying led the European Union to take action. Twenty-six E.U. ambassadors wrote a joint letter in 2018 arguing that children should have the right to see both parents, citing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. That message was forcefully underlined with a resolution of the European Parliament in July.
            
            Now European lawmakers are pressing the E.U. to link its 2019 trade deal with Japan to the custody issue under a parallel agreement that commits both sides to respect international human rights treaties.
            
            “Foreign pressure is becoming increasingly crucial,” said Seiichi Kushida, an opposition lawmaker who has been leading calls for change in Japan’s parliament, the Diet. “Public support for our proposals is still not as strong as we hope it to be, so the walls we have been up against are thick.”
            
            Under then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the government set up a panel to research legal issues concerning custody and look at the systems in 24 other countries — almost all allowing joint custody.
            
            That panel doesn’t have the power to propose legislation, but Kushida has “high expectations” that Japan’s new justice minister, Yoko Kamikawa, appointed to the role for a second time last month, will help push for change in the law.
            
            Kamikawa was deputy chair of a group of 90 lawmakers — out of 713 in the Diet — lobbying for joint custody.
            
            “It is important to take the utmost benefit of children into consideration,” she told the Yomiuri newspaper shortly after taking office. “That is in line with global trends, and I would like to continue discussions.”
            
            In previous decades, men worked long hours, and women looked after children. Courts awarded custody to women in about 90 percent of cases. Today, more Japanese men are seeking custody after divorce — and more women are finding themselves denied access to their children.
            
            At a remarkable news conference last month, 23 mothers and one grandmother — including one Australian woman — told heartbreaking stories of being denied access to children.
            
            Izumi said her children’s schools have refused to help, and a public help desk for children refused to intervene because it said it saw no evidence of physical abuse.
            
            “Today, my husband only sends me photos once every two months. He says even doing that is against the well-being of our children. But what is ‘the well-being of children’ all about? I don’t know who I can turn to.”

        <header>The Hague convention in Japan</header>
        <p>Prior to entry into force of the Convention in Japan in 2014, when a child was removed to a foreign state, the left-behind parent needed to find the whereabouts of the (ex-) spouse and child all by him-or herself, overcoming barriers of different law and culture, and to file a lawsuit for the return of the child to a foreign court. Furthermore, where a Japanese parent divorced in a foreign state who wished to make a temporary return to Japan with his or her child, despite a court of the foreign state would not permit the Japanese parent to do so, as it was considered that the temporary return could possibly develop into a retention of the child given that a procedure for the return of the child was not guaranteed based on the Convention.
            However, the conclusion of the Convention made possible for Japan to make use of the international cooperation mechanism to undertake procedures for the return of the child from the foreign state and to secure opportunity for parent-child access.
            Specifically the rules for the return of the removed child became clear, bringing about an international standard, namely the Convention, to follow in order to solve problems and help the Japanese living abroad to overcome constraints that they used to face because the international rule is now applicable.
            Also it is expected that the travel constraints on Japanese people in a foreign state with his or her child based on the status of Japan's non-contracting state of the Hague Convention can now be alleviated.
            The principle of the Convention that a wrongfully removed child from one parent in breach of the custody rights should be returned is an effective safeguard against future child removals. What is also expected is that a parent and child residing in different countries across borders would have more opportunity to meet each other.</p>

        <header>JAPAN, U.S. REAFFIRM COMMITMENT TO THE HAGUE CONVENTION AND TO THE RESOLUTION OF ABDUCTION CASES</header>
        <p>
            On November 17, 2020, virtual Japan-U.S. consultations were held on the issue of child abduction between Japan and the United States of America. The Japanese side was represented by Yutaka Arima, Deputy Director-General, North American Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the U.S. side was represented by Michelle Bernier-Toth, Special Advisor for Children’s Issues, Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State.

As a result of the consultations, both sides reaffirmed the following:
<ul>
<li>Both sides recognized the progress made in resolving many abduction cases between Japan and the United States of America since the Hague Convention (the Convention on the Civil Aspects on International Child Abduction) came into force in Japan in 2014, and both Governments continued to commit to the full implementation of the Convention.</li>
<li>Both sides expressed their continued concern for the resolution of child abduction cases that occurred prior to the entry into force of the Hague Convention in Japan. The respective authorities will continue to hold regular consultations on these cases.</li>
<li>Regarding these pre-Hague cases, in order to identify best practices, lessons learned, and obstacles to resolution that may affect the remaining open cases, both sides have reviewed all cases still open in Japan at the time of the Convention’s entry into force to determine their status and resolution. After this review, both sides observed that in nearly one-half of all such cases, parents were able to reach agreement through mediation, whether voluntary or with the guidance of the court system. These resolutions included the voluntary return of the child and/or access agreements in most of these cases. Both sides therefore noted the importance of mediation and open dialogue in the best interest of the child or children as a best practice for such cases.</li>
<li>Both sides are pleased to issue updated information about available options and resources – both in the United States of America and in Japan – to all parents as they seek a satisfactory resolution to their cases. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs information can be found online here , and the U.S. Department of State information can be found online here  and here.</li>
